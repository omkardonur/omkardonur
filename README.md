## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a **Full Stack Developer with 1.5+ years of industry experience**, specializing in **backend development** and internal enterprise platforms. I currently work on a **multi-module production system** that supports core business workflows such as payouts, task management, ticketing, asset handling, certifications, and user management.

I enjoy working close to real-world problems — designing APIs, enforcing security through authentication and authorization, and building systems that teams actually rely on in production.

I also lead a small engineering team, conduct code reviews, and mentor junior developers.
